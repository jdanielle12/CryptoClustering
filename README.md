### Introduction
Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatile nature and understanding their behavior is challening. This project aims to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data, specifically focusing on price change percentages over different time intervals (24 hours, 7 days, etc.). The clustering is performed using K-Means, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm, and the dimensionality of the data is reduced using PCA to improve computational efficiency and interpretability.
